            Tales of the Round Table: A Short-Story Roleplaying Game
          </a>

          I contributed to the design and playtesting of <em>Tales of the Roundtable</em>, a GM-less, short-form tabletop role-playing game. My involvement spanned both the early conceptual stages and the final phase leading up to launch. I also named the game.

          During development, I collaborated on core mechanics, ran early playtests, and helped refine the user experience through iterative feedback. In the closing stages, I served as a principal playtester, focusing on polish, edge cases, and flow.

          <em>Tales</em> diverges from traditional RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder. It was intentionally designed for:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>No game master – narrative responsibilities are shared among all players.</li>
          <li>Minimal setup – reducing the "lag time until fun" that often delays engagement in story-heavy games.</li>
          <li>Short session design – a complete story arc within a single sitting.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Within those constraints, we succeeded in building a consistent, engaging role-playing experience. While the condensed format naturally limits some of the emotional highs and lows that emerge in longer campaigns, it immediately delivers accessible, collaborative storytelling with little friction and strong replayability.
