          Riot Games – League Studio Information Architecture
        </h4>
        <p>
          In collaboration with another technical writer, I led efforts to identify and resolve systemic documentation challenges across League Studio at Riot Games. We uncovered a "docs death spiral," where outdated documentation, fragmented planning artifacts, and unclear ownership contributed to a loss of trust in internal resources. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Contributing factors included multiple migrations from legacy Confluence servers, shifting team structures without proper documentation handoff, and a startup-style approach to documentation that no longer scaled within a 4,000+ person organization. To address this, we developed and implemented a new documentation strategy and reorganized the information architecture around product-centric documentation. This included auditing and cleaning up more than 5,000 pages across League Studio.

          Kaiser Permanente – Financial and Operational Data Dictionaries
        </h4>
        <p>
          At Kaiser Permanente, I created comprehensive data dictionaries within Confluence to support a wide range of stakeholders, from data entry technicians to developers to executive leadership. These dictionaries standardized definitions and improved clarity across business units. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of the project, I authored 18 structured data dictionaries, documenting more than 370 financial and hospital performance metrics. The deliverables improved data literacy, reduced reporting discrepancies, and directly supported the organization's enterprise dashboard initiatives.
