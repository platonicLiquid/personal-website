        Hi, I'm Matthew Yocum.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm a software developer and technical writer with a strong background in building data pipelines, web scraping tools, API integrations, and managing databases. My primary language is Python, though I've also worked professionally with JavaScript, SQL, and VBA, among others.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I began coding in 2014 and have consistently used programming to streamline and enhance workflows across all my roles. Since 2019, I've been transitioning from a technical writing career into full-time software development, taking on increasingly complex projects to deepen my engineering experience. At Riot Games, I spent my final 9 months contributing nearly full-time as a developer.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After Riot, I chose to focus full-time on building my own products and delivering client-focused solutions that combine modern frontends, reliable backends, and thoughtful documentation. I founded two companies: <strong>eetah.io</strong>, a web and app development practice where I build with Vite on the frontend and Cloudflare Workers on the backend (including authentication, 2FA, customer management, and Stripe integration); and <strong>writing-pros.com</strong>, a technical writing and copywriting firm I co-founded to deliver clear, high-impact content for technology and manufacturing clients. Growing these businesses has allowed me to keep shipping, learning, and refining my craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond client work, I continue to develop personal projects using React and Vite. I’ve integrated AI capabilities via OpenAI’s API—focusing on prompt engineering and intelligent application features—and earned a machine learning certification, applying that foundation to explore practical, real-world use cases.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I believe in clear, effective communication—especially when translating complex technical topics into accessible language. I'm a strong advocate for “docs-as-code” practices and value maintainable, well-documented systems.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy gaming, Byzantine chant and choral singing, exploring philosophy and political science, and designing tabletop role-playing games.
