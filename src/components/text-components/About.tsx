        Hi, I'm Matthew Yocum.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I'm a software developer and technical writer with a strong background in building data pipelines, web scraping tools, API integrations, and managing databases. My primary language is Python, though I've also worked professionally with JavaScript, SQL, and VBA, among others.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I began coding in 2014 and have consistently used programming to streamline and enhance workflows across all my roles. Since 2019, I've been transitioning from a technical writing career into full-time software development, taking on increasingly complex projects to deepen my engineering experience. At Riot Games, I spent my final 9 months there contributing nearly full-time as a developer.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Since the conclusion of my contract with Riot Games, the job market has been extraordinarily challenging. In the absence of new opportunities, I've focused on creating my own. I founded two companies: <strong>eetah.io</strong>, a web and app development business where I build modern frontend applications with Vite and use Cloudflare Workers for backend infrastructure; and <strong>writing-pros.com</strong>, a technical writing and copywriting firm launched with a partner to deliver clear, high-impact content to tech and manufacturing focused clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond client work, I continue to develop personal projects using modern web technologies, particularly React and Vite. I've also integrated AI capabilities into some of my applications using OpenAI's API, focusing on prompt engineering and intelligent user interaction. I've completed coursework to earn a machine learning certification and continue to explore its practical applications.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I believe in clear, effective communicationâ€”especially when translating complex technical topics into accessible language. I'm a strong advocate for "docs like code" practices and value maintainable, well-documented systems.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy gaming, Byzantine chant and choral singing, exploring philosophy and political science, and designing tabletop role-playing games.
