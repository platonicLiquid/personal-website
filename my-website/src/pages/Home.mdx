Hi! I'm Matthew Yocum!

I am a software developer and technical writer. I have experience with data pipelines, web scraping, API
integration, and database management. I am very proficient in Python. I have also used a bunch of languages
like JavaScript, SQL, VBA, and others in professional settings.

I have been coding since 2014 and have always found a way to use scripts/programming to make my life
easier in all of my jobs. Since 2019, I have been transitioning from a tech writing career into dev
roles and seriously pursuing a career in software development. To that end, I have taken on projects to
prove my development skills in professional settings. In my last year and a half at Riot Games, I was
moonlighting nearly full-time as a developer.

Outside of work, I have taken on a bunch of personal projects to learn frameworks like React, Django,
and Flask. I am also working on improving the Notion API wrapper to integrate with Notion's official
API. The first fruit of those projects is this website.

I am a big proponent of docs like code and communicating complex subjects simply. A pipe dream of mine
is to develop systems that allow docs to live on multiple platforms and allow edits to be made on every
platform the docs live.

Outside of work, I enjoy gaming; Byzantine chant and choir; studying philosophy and political science;
and designing table-top role-playing games.
