Hi! I'm Matthew Yocum!

I am a software developer and technical writer with experience in data pipelines, web scraping, API integration, and database management. I am very proficient in Python and have used various languages like JavaScript, SQL, VBA, and others in professional settings.

I have been coding since 2014 and have always found ways to use scripts/programming to make my life easier in all of my jobs. Since 2019, I have been transitioning from a tech writing career into development roles and seriously pursuing a career in software development. To that end, I have taken on projects to prove my development skills in professional settings. In my last year and a half at Riot Games, I was moonlighting nearly full-time as a developer.

Outside of work, I have taken on numerous personal projects to learn frameworks like React, Django, and Flask. I am also working on improving the Notion API wrapper to integrate with Notion's official API. The first fruit of those projects is this website.

I am a big proponent of docs like code and communicating complex subjects simply.

In my free time, I enjoy gaming, Byzantine chant and choir, studying philosophy and political science, and designing tabletop role-playing games.
