I am a software developer and technical writer. I have experience
with data pipelines, web scraping, API integration, and database
management. I am very proficient in Python. I have also used a bunch
of languages like Javascript, SQL, VBA, and others in professional
settings.

I have been coding since 2014 and have always found a way to use
scripts/programming to make my life easier in all of my jobs. Since
2019 I have been transitioning from a tech writing career into dev
roles and seriously pursuing a career in software development.

To that end, I have taken on projects to prove my development skills
in professional settings. Outside of work, I have taken on a bunch
of personal projects to learn frameworks like React, Django, and
Flask. I am also working on improving the Notion API wrapper to
integrate with Notion's official API. The first fruit of those
projects is this website.

I am a big propoenent of docs like code and communicating complex
subjects simply. A pipe dream of mine is to develop systems that
allow docs to live on multiple platforms and allow edits to be made
on every platform the docs live.

Outside of work, I enjoy gaming; Byzantine chant and choir; studying
philosopy and political science; and desinging table-top role
playing games.
