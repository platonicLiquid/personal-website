# Riot Games League Studio Information Architecture

Working alongside another Technical Writer in League Studio, we identified a "docs death spiral" in League Studio where documentation was not being updated and items like team and sprint planning notes lived with product documentation. We identified several compounding factors as causes of this "docs death spiral": multiple documentation migrations from legacy Confluence servers; shifting team structure without clear docs owernship transitioning with teams; and a startup culture towards documentation that no longer worked for >4k employees. We designed and implemented a strategy to clean up the 5000+ docs in League Studio and reorganize our documentation Information Architecture around product documentation.
