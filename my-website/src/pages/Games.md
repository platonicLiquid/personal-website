# Tales of the Roundtable Game Design and Playtesting

**Kickstarter:** <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mythweavergames/tales-of-the-round-table/description" target="\_blank">Tales of the Round Table: A Short-Story Roleplaying Game</a>

**Overview:**

I was invloved in the making of a table-top role-playing game called Tales of the Roundtable. My involvement was during the beginning stages of development and the end stages just prior to release.

I co-designed and playtested early versions of Tales. In the final stages just before release, I was a principal playtester. I named the game.

Tales is not like "traditional" RPGs like DnD or Pathfinder. It is instead, a short-form, GMless roleplaying game that is designed to be played in a single session. Our design constraints included:

- No GM/DM; this role was to be distributed amongst all the players.
- Reducing "lag time till fun" that happens in most traditional RPGs. We wanted the great parts of Story-Now RPGs to be accessible immediately.
- Reducing the time it takes to play an full session of an RPG.

Overall, we were sucessful within those design constraints, we made a great game IMO, but it came with some tradeoffs. For example, some of the highest highs and lowest lows in playing games have come from playing table top RPGs in my own experience. Tales, through it's short gameplay, reduces the likelihood of those "lows", but it also ended up reducing the likelihood of the "highest highs". It does, however, provide a consitently fun roleplaying experience.
