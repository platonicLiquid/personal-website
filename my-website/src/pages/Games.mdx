**Overview:**

I was involved in the making of a tabletop role-playing game called Tales of the Roundtable. My involvement was during the beginning stages of development and the end stages just prior to release.

I co-designed and playtested early versions of Tales. In the final stages just before release, I was a principal playtester. I named the game.

Tales is not like traditional RPGs such as DnD or Pathfinder. Instead, it is a short-form, GMless role-playing game designed to be played in a single session. Our design constraints included:

- No GM/DM; this role was to be distributed amongst all the players.
- Reducing the "lag time till fun" that occurs in most traditional RPGs. We wanted the great parts of Story-Now RPGs to be accessible immediately.
- Reducing the time it takes to play a full session of an RPG.

Overall, we were successful within those design constraints. We made a great game, in my opinion, but it came with some trade-offs. For example, some of the highest highs and lowest lows in playing games have come from playing tabletop RPGs in my own experience. Tales, through its short gameplay, reduces the likelihood of those "lows," but it also ended up reducing the likelihood of the "highest highs." It does, however, provide a consistently fun role-playing experience.
