# Tales of the Roundtable Game Design and Playtesting

**Kickstarter:** <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mythweavergames/tales-of-the-round-table/description" target="\_blank">Tales of the Round Table: A Short-Story Roleplaying Game</a>

## Overview

I was invloved in the making of a table-top role-playing game called Tales of the Roundtable. My involvement was during the beginning stages of development and the end stages just prior to release.

I co-designed and playtested early versions of Tales. In the final stages just before release, I was a principal playtester. I named the game.

Tales is not like "traditional" RPGs like DnD or Pathfinder.
