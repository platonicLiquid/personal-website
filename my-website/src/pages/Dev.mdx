# League Studio Confluence to Notion Migration

**Project Description:**

During my tenure at Riot Games, we switched from Confluence to <a href="https://notion.so" target="_blank">Notion</a> for documentation. For the business units I supported in League Studio, I designed and implemented a strategy to migrate Confluence docs into Notion. Due to problems with Notion's importer tools and reporting, I wrote extensive Python scripts to verify that pages were migrated successfully, provide reporting for known issues in migrating from Confluence to Notion, and update Confluence page headers to direct users to the new Notion pages.
