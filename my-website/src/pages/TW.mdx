# Riot Games League Studio Information Architecture

Working alongside another Technical Writer in League Studio, we identified a "docs death spiral" where documentation was not being updated and items like team and sprint planning notes were mixed with product documentation. We identified several compounding factors as causes of this "docs death spiral": multiple documentation migrations from legacy Confluence servers; shifting team structures without clear documentation ownership transitioning with teams; and a startup culture towards documentation that no longer worked for an organization with over 4,000 employees. We designed and implemented a strategy to clean up the 5,000+ documents in League Studio and reorganize our documentation Information Architecture around product documentation.

# Kaiser Permanente Data Dictionaries

I designed and implemented Confluence data dictionaries for a wide range of audiences, including data entry techs, developers, and upper management. I created 18 data dictionaries and documented over 370 financial and hospital measures.
